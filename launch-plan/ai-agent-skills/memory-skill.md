# Memory Skill

Enable your agent to remember and reference past conversations for a more personalized user experience. This setting configures how memory works, including memory scope and retention policy.

### Personal vs Shared Memory

You can setup Memory to be Personal (Private to the User) or Shared (Available to anyone who communicates with the Agent).&#x20;

**Shared Memory**

Use Shared Memory if your agent will remember any communication across multiple users and be able to share that information to anyone communicating to the Agent. A sample use case would be if you have an Agent who is coordinating a project, and all the team members of the project are communicating updates to the Agent - the Agent will commit those conversations to it's memory so everyone can benefit.

**Personal Memory**

Use Personal Memory if you want to be the only user who has access to the memory. A sample use case would be if your agent is a personal assistant and you are sharing information you do not want other users to access in conversations.
