# File Transformation

### **Converting Files in raia Academy**

### **Overview**

raia Academy enables you to convert virtually any file into an **AI‑Ready** format—**Markdown (.md)** or **JSON (.json)**—before uploading into the vector store.

\
This ensures your data is clean, structured, and optimized for AI Agent training, regardless of the original file format.

### **Why AI‑Ready Conversion Matters**

Your source data may come from many places and formats:

* **Documents:** PDF, DOC/DOCX, TXT
* **Presentations:** PPT/PPTX
* **Spreadsheets & Data Files:** CSV, XLS/XLSX
* **Others:** HTML, JSON, Markdown

Each of these formats has its own structure, quirks, and limitations. Without proper conversion, AI models may:

* Miss important text hidden in layouts or tables.
* Misinterpret the structure of the content.
* Produce poor retrieval accuracy due to inconsistent chunking.
* Include “noise” from headers, footers, or formatting artifacts.

By transforming files into **clean, structured, and consistent Markdown or JSON**, raia Academy ensures:

* **Consistent formatting** across all knowledge sources.
* **Preserved semantic structure** (headings, lists, tables).
* **High‑quality embeddings** for accurate AI Agent responses.
* **Reliable chunking** so each information block is coherent.

### **How raia Academy Processes Your Files**

1. **Upload Your Files**
   * Drag & drop files directly into raia Academy.
   * Or bulk import from a **shared drive** for large-scale processing.
2. **AI‑Powered Parsing**
   * Automatically detects file type.
   * Extracts **unstructured text** (narratives, descriptions, notes).
   * Extracts **structured data** (tables, CSV fields, spreadsheet data).
3. **Normalization & Cleaning**
   * Removes unnecessary formatting noise.
   * Preserves hierarchy using **Markdown** (for text-heavy docs) or **JSON** (for structured datasets).
   * Applies **semantic chunking** so information is split at logical points.
4. **AI‑Ready Output**
   * **Markdown (.md)**: Ideal for narrative documents, manuals, and reports.
   * **JSON (.json)**: Ideal for structured data, field/value pairs, and tabular content.

### Pushing Files to AI Agents

### **Pushing to AI Agents**

Once files are converted:

1. Select **one or more AI Agents** in the raia Platform.
2. Push the processed files **directly to the Agent’s vector store**.
3. Files are immediately available for:
   * Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
   * Natural language queries.
   * Agent reasoning and training.

### **Managing Files in raia Academy**

* **Assign to specific agents** so knowledge is targeted.
* **Easily remove outdated files** from an agent’s vector store to keep responses relevant.
* **Re-upload updated versions** without disrupting other knowledge sources.



### Bulk Upload of Files into raia Academy

### **Key Benefits**

* **Format Agnostic** – Works with PDFs, Word docs, PowerPoints, spreadsheets, and more.
* **Data Consistency** – Clean, predictable format improves AI reliability.
* **Faster Deployment** – Upload → Convert → Push to Agents in minutes.
* **Scalable** – Bulk process hundreds of files with shared drive import.
* **Governance-Friendly** – Track, update, and remove files anytime.

***

### **Example Workflow**

1. Drop a **100-page PDF report** into raia Academy.
2. Academy extracts text, tables, and headings → converts to `.md`.
3. Push the `.md` to your **Market Research AI Agent**.
4.  The agent can now instantly answer:

    > “Summarize the Q4 trends from the latest market report.”
5. Later, update the report → Academy replaces the old version in the vector store.

***

### **Best Practices**

* **Choose Markdown** for textual/narrative-heavy content.
* **Choose JSON** for tabular, database-like, or structured content.
* Keep your files **organized by topic** before upload for easier agent assignment.
* Use the **remove** function in Academy to instantly pull outdated knowledge.
