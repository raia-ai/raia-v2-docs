# Chat

Live Chat with raia is one of the core communication skills available to any AI Agent built on the raia platform.&#x20;

**Chat is an app that is part of the raia cX Suite.**

***

#### 🔧 **Setup and Customization**

Live Chat is enabled by default as a basic skill on every new agent and can be configured during the agent creation process within the Launch Pad wizard. Users can:

* Set a **Welcome Message** and introduction text
* Define **predefined replies** and a **disclaimer**
* Customize the **chat widget’s appearance** (color, icon, branding)
* Add **custom links** to support content or CTAs
* Restrict access by IP or geography

A live preview shows how the chat will look and behave in real-time, so users can test interactions before deploying.

***

#### 💬 **Live Chat Experience for End Users**

Once deployed:

* The Live Chat widget appears on websites or portals.
* Users can interact with the AI Agent in a real-time chat interface.
* Conversations happen asynchronously or in real-time and are recorded in threads for auditing and improvement.

Live Chat supports **public and anonymous access**, meaning end users can start chatting without logging in.

***

#### 👥 **Roles and Oversight**

* Admins can view and manage all live chat threads in **Copilot**, raia’s interface for monitoring, training, and interacting with AI Agents.
* Admins and authorized users can **take over live conversations** in real-time using "human-in-the-loop" mode.
* Conversations are scored (1-10) to track interaction quality and effectiveness.

***

#### 🧠 **Training and Feedback**

* Every live chat conversation can be rated by users or admins.
* Feedback (thumbs up/down, suggested responses) can be submitted via CoPilot, enabling rapid iteration and continuous training.

***

#### 🔐 **Security and Control**

* Live Chat is hosted on SOC2-compliant infrastructure.
* Organizations can control access to agents and chats using permissions (Admin, Authenticated User, Public User).
* Detailed logs and conversation history are stored and searchable.
