# Building Targeted Lists with the Apollo.io Integration

Effective outreach begins with a high-quality, targeted list of contacts. RAIA Control streamlines this crucial first step with a direct integration with Apollo.io, a leading sales intelligence and engagement platform. This allows you to build and import lists of new, targeted contacts without ever leaving the RAIA Control environment.

### The List Builder Feature

The List Builds section in RAIA Control is your dedicated hub for acquiring new contacts from Apollo.io. This feature is designed to bridge the gap between prospecting and outreach, creating a seamless workflow for lead generation.

#### Key Benefits

* **Efficiency**: Eliminates the need to manually search for contacts in Apollo, export them to a CSV, and then import them into RAIA Control. The entire process is managed from a single interface.
* **Targeting**: Leverage Apollo.io’s powerful search and filtering capabilities to build highly specific lists of your ideal customer profile.
* **Automation**: Once a request is submitted, RAIA Control automatically pulls the contacts and adds them to your designated list, ready for engagement.

### How to Build a List

Building a new list is a straightforward process that involves creating a search in Apollo.io and then using that search to create a List Build request in RAIA Control.

#### Step 1: Create a Saved Search in Apollo.io

Before you can request a list in RAIA Control, you must first define your target audience in Apollo.io.

1. Log in to your Apollo.io account.
2. Use the Search functionality to build a query that accurately reflects your ideal customer profile. You can filter by job title, company industry, location, company size, and many other attributes.
3. Once you are satisfied with your search results, save the search. This will generate a unique URL for that specific search query.
4. Copy the URL of your saved search. This is the key piece of information you will need in RAIA Control.

#### Step 2: Create a List Build Request in RAIA Control

With your Apollo.io search URL in hand, you can now create a request in RAIA Control.

1. Navigate to the List Builds section from the main navigation sidebar.
2. Click the "New List Build Request" button.
3. Fill out the request form:

* **Request Name:** Give your request a descriptive name for future reference (e.g., "US-Based SaaS Founders - Q3 2024").
* **Apollo.io Search URL:** Paste the URL of your saved search from Apollo.io.
* **Number of Contacts:** Specify the number of contacts you wish to import from the search results.
* **Target List:** Select an existing RAIA Control list where the new contacts will be added. It is a good practice to create a new, dedicated list for each list build request to keep your contacts organized.

4. Click "Submit Request".

#### Step 3: Monitor and Access Your New Contacts

Once you submit the request, RAIA Control will begin processing it. The status of your request will be visible in the List Builds dashboard.

* **Processing**: The system is actively pulling the requested contacts from Apollo.io.
* **Completed**: The process is finished, and the new contacts have been successfully added to your specified list.

After the request is complete, you can navigate to the Contacts section and view the target list you selected. You will see the newly imported contacts, ready to be included in your next outreach mission.

By leveraging the Apollo.io integration, you can ensure a steady stream of high-quality leads, powering your automated outreach efforts and driving consistent growth.
