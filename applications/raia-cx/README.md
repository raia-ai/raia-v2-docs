### Intro to cX

Traditional customer support traps expertise in individual representatives' minds—when they're unavailable or leave, that knowledge is lost forever. raiaCX transforms this model by creating a continuously learning knowledge model that is trained on your data and improved every day by your support team through human feedback.&#x20;

As your team solves problems and provides feedback, the AI captures that expertise and makes it accessible to every customer, 24/7, through autonomous agents that don't just answer questions—they take action to resolve issues. The result is a support organization where knowledge is democratized, customers get instant expert-level help, and your system gets smarter with every interaction instead of becoming outdated.

### Five Strong Features

#### **Feature 1:** Continuously Learning Knowledge Model

Your AI gets smarter every day, not outdated every month.

Unlike static AI solutions that are deployed once and remain unchanged, raiaCX creates a living knowledge model that is continuously trained and improved by your support team through human feedback. Every time a representative solves a problem, provides a correction, or discovers a new solution, that expertise is captured and incorporated into the model. This means your AI doesn't just maintain its effectiveness—it compounds intelligence over time, becoming more accurate, more capable, and more valuable with every interaction.

#### **Feature 2: Knowledge Democratization**

Transform expertise from individual minds to organizational intelligence.

Your best support representatives have years of accumulated knowledge—but in traditional models, that expertise is locked in their heads and lost when they leave. raiaCX democratizes this knowledge across your entire organization by capturing solutions, insights, and expertise in a shared model. When experienced reps leave, their knowledge stays. When new reps join, they have instant access to your team's collective wisdom. Every customer benefits from your organization's best thinking, not just whoever happens to answer their ticket.

#### **Feature 3:** Autonomous Agents That Take Action

Most AI can talk. raiaCX can work.

raiaCX goes far beyond conversation-based chatbots to deliver autonomous agents that take real action on behalf of your customers. Our agents integrate with your existing systems—Zendesk, Salesforce, Netsuite, and more—to access customer-specific data, execute workflows, create and update tickets, process requests, and resolve issues end-to-end. This means customers don't just get information about how to solve their problem—they get their problem actually solved, often in minutes instead of hours or days.

#### **Feature 4:** Customer Autonomy with Expert-Level Support

Give customers instant access to expertise, 24/7—no wait times, no frustration.

The ultimate goal of raiaCX is customer autonomy: enabling your customers to get expert-level answers and resolutions instantly, without waiting for a human agent. Our continuously learning model, trained on your organization's collective knowledge, delivers the same quality of support at 3 AM as it does at 3 PM. Customers get immediate, accurate answers powered by your team's expertise, with seamless escalation to human agents when needed for complex or sensitive issues. This transforms the customer experience from "I need to wait for help" to "I can get help right now."

#### **Feature 5**: Deep Reasoning Powered by GPT-5

Built on best-of-breed AI, trained on your business.

While embedded AI in platforms like Zendesk and Salesforce relies on basic keyword search, raiaCX builds custom knowledge models with deep reasoning capabilities powered by GPT-5 and other best-of-breed foundation models. This enables our agents to understand context, reason through multi-step problems, handle Tier 1-3 support, and provide solutions that go far beyond simple article retrieval. Combined with continuous learning from your team's feedback, this creates AI agents that are both broadly intelligent and deeply expert in your specific business.
