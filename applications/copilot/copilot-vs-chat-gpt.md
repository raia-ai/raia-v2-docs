# Copilot vs Chat GPT

When you first experience raia Copilot you will notice the user experience is very similar to ChatGPT. Our goal was to give your team a familiar interface to minimize training and allow your team to have the benefits of the OpenAI general AI model as well as the custom AI Agents you deploy in your business.

### Built on the same Models <a href="#built-on-the-same-models" id="built-on-the-same-models"></a>

ChatGPT and raia Copilot are built on the same foundational model by OpenAI. The different is raia Copilot is leveraging the Enterprise license of OpenAI which meets the highest level of security and compliance standards and ensures no data will be used for training by OpenAI.

raia Copilot's primary use is to access custom AI Agents that are built using raia Launch Pad. Of course, you can launch a generic "Chat GPT" agent to provide general access to the OpenAI models, but the most powerful uses of raia Copilot is building custom AI Agents trained on your business and integrated into your systems to automate work and empower your team to scale performance.

### More than just Single-User <a href="#more-than-just-single-user" id="more-than-just-single-user"></a>

raia Copilot is built for the Enterprise and provides key functionality required when building an Agentic Workforce. Whereas ChatGPT is a single-user interface where the user is simply prompting the AI and receiving responses, raia Copilot enables Human-in-the-Loop capability allowing access to an agent's conversations with multiple users.

### Supports Omni-Channel Communication

raia’s **Copilot** offers a unified, omni-channel view of all conversations—regardless of how they started. Whether a user engages with your AI Agent via **SMS**, **Email**, **Live Chat**, or directly through **Copilot**, every thread is captured and accessible in one centralized interface. This means admins and team members can monitor, review, and train agents from a single dashboard, ensuring consistency in responses and enabling streamlined feedback across every channel your business supports.
