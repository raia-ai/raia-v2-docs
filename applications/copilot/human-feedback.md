## 🧠 How to Provide Human Feedback in Copilot to Train Your AI Agent

Training an AI Agent isn’t a one-time event—it’s a continuous process. That’s why RAIA’s **Copilot** includes built-in tools to help you easily **review, rate, and improve your Agent's responses** with human feedback.

Whether the AI gave a perfect answer or totally missed the mark, your feedback helps the Agent learn from real-world interactions and perform better over time.

***

### 👀 What is Human Feedback in Copilot?

RAIA allows Admins and Users (with proper permissions) to leave feedback on any AI-generated response. This feedback can be:

* A simple **thumbs up or thumbs down**
* A written **comment explaining why**
* A **suggested replacement** response
* A toggle to **include the feedback in future training**

You can leave feedback directly within any conversation in **Copilot**, no matter where the conversation originated (SMS, Email, Live Chat, or Copilot itself).

***

### 🔧 How to Leave Feedback in Copilot

Here’s how to provide feedback that improves your AI over time:

***

#### 1. Open Copilot and Go Into a Conversation

* Go to [https://raiaapp.com](https://raiaapp.com/) and log in
* Select the AI Agent you'd like to review
* Use **Admin Mode** (if available) to see all threads
* Click on a conversation that includes AI responses you want to evaluate

***

#### 2. Review the AI’s Messages

* Scroll through the thread and locate any AI-generated message
* You’ll see **thumb icons** under each AI message:
  * 👍 = Good response
  * 👎 = Needs improvement

***

#### 3. Click a Thumb to Rate the Message

When you click a thumb, a feedback modal will appear where you can add more detail:

**Feedback Modal Fields:**

| Field                                | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comment (optional)**               | Explain why the response was good or bad                  |
| **Suggested Replacement (optional)** | Provide a better version of the response                  |
| **Include in Training (toggle)**     | Choose whether to submit this feedback to training memory |

💡 _You can copy the original response into the replacement field and tweak it, rather than starting from scratch._

***

#### 4. Submit Feedback

Once your feedback is complete:

* Click **Submit**
* Your comment is saved to the message
* The system stores it for admin review and training updates

You’ll also see a confirmation that your feedback has been saved.

***

### 🧪 Where Does the Feedback Go?

All submitted feedback is:

* Logged to the conversation and visible in the thread history
* Available in **Admin Mode** for future reference
* Eligible to be added to **training memory** by an admin
* Used to fine-tune agent behavior and responses in the next update cycle

***

### 🧠 Best Practices for Effective Feedback

| Tip                                    | Why It Matters                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Be specific in comments                | Helps identify the exact issue or strength  |
| Use suggested replacement field        | The AI learns from high-quality rewrites    |
| Focus on tone, relevance, and accuracy | These are the most common failure points    |
| Don’t skip positive feedback!          | Reinforces good patterns the AI should keep |

***

### 🧩 Bonus: Train from a Conversation

In **Admin Mode**, you can take an entire conversation thread and:

* Mark it as useful
* Add it to the Agent's **training memory**
* Use it as a future benchmark for behavior

This is especially powerful for edge cases or high-value scenarios (like onboarding or escalation responses).

***

### ✅ Summary

RAIA’s Human Feedback tools in Copilot allow your team to:

* Review conversations across all channels
* Rate individual AI messages
* Suggest improvements with natural language
* Contribute directly to agent training—without writing code

It's the easiest way to **make your AI smarter, more helpful, and better aligned with your team’s needs**.
