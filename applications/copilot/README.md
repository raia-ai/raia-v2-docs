### Copilot is your Team's Access to your AI Agents <a href="#copilot-is-your-teams-access-to-your-ai-agents" id="copilot-is-your-teams-access-to-your-ai-agents"></a>

Your team can now access the AI Agents you build using [**raia Launchpad**](https://www.raiaai.com/ai-agents). Think of it as a version of ChatGPT customized specifically for your business. The Agent Co-Pilot is designed to work within your existing processes, ensuring that your data remains secure and is never used for external model training. With raia, you maintain full control over the scope and utility of your AI, empowering your team to achieve more, faster.
