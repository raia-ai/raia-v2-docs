# Human in the Loop

## 👤 Using Human-in-the-Loop Mode in Copilot

RAIA’s **Copilot** gives Admins the ability to monitor and manage all AI-powered conversations in real time—across every channel. With **Human-in-the-Loop Mode**, Admins can temporarily pause the AI and take over the conversation manually, ensuring sensitive, nuanced, or high-value interactions are handled with a human touch.

### 🔍 What is Admin Mode?

When you're in **Admin Mode** (available only to users with admin access to an AI Agent), you can:

* View **all conversations** across every channel:
  * **SMS**
  * **Email**
  * **Live Chat**
  * **Copilot (internal chat)**
* See the full context of a conversation, including user details, scores, and message history
* Provide feedback on agent responses (thumbs up/down, comments, training suggestions)

Admin Mode is the foundation for advanced monitoring, coaching, and intervention.

### 🤝 What is Human-in-the-Loop Mode?

**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Mode** allows you to **take over** a conversation from the AI in real time.

This is useful when:

* The AI gets stuck or misunderstood the context
* A conversation requires sensitive handling
* A high-priority customer or lead needs white-glove service

When activated, HITL Mode **disables the AI for that specific thread**, and **you (the admin) take control** of the conversation directly through Copilot.

### 🧑‍🏫 How to Use Human-in-the-Loop Mode

Follow these steps to activate and use HITL mode in a live thread:

***

#### 1. Enter Admin Mode

* Open **Copilot** at [https://raiaapp.com](https://raiaapp.com/)
* Select the Agent you administer
* Ensure you are in **Admin Mode** (toggle available at top of agent interface)

***

#### 2. Open the Conversation

* Navigate to the **Threads** tab or **search** for the user by name, email, or phone
* Click on the conversation you want to view or intervene in
* You’ll see message history, channel type, and scoring info

***

#### 3. Activate Human-in-the-Loop

* At the bottom of the message panel, click **“Take Over Conversation”**
* A confirmation prompt will appear:\
  ✅ _“Are you sure you want to disable AI and respond as a human in this thread?”_
* Confirm to enter **Human-in-the-Loop Mode**

Once activated:

* AI will **stop responding** for this conversation
* Messages you send will appear with **your name and admin tag** under the message
* The user won’t be notified they’re now chatting with a human—but you can mention it if needed

***

#### 4. Continue the Conversation

* Use the chat input as normal
* Respond as yourself (messages will be styled differently than AI messages)
* You can still reference context, view prior AI messages, and see the user’s profile on the right panel

***

#### 5. Exit HITL Mode (Optional)

* Once the situation is resolved, you can **return control to the AI**:
  * Click **“Return to AI”**
  * A message will appear confirming AI will resume responses in the next message

Note: If no action is taken, the conversation remains in HITL until manually reset.

***

### 🔐 Permissions & Controls

Only **Agent Admins** (or Org Admins) have access to Admin Mode and Human-in-the-Loop functionality.

* Regular users or editors **cannot take over threads**
* All takeovers are **logged** and appear in the conversation metadata for audit purposes

### ✅ Best Practices

| When to Use HITL           | Why It Helps                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| High-stakes leads or deals | Adds a human layer to close or escalate effectively     |
| AI hits an edge case       | You can resolve and use the thread as a training moment |
| Escalations or complaints  | Protect brand tone and reduce risk                      |
| Sensitive topics           | Human empathy outperforms automation                    |
