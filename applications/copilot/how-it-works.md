# How it works

## How it Works

The user experience of Copilot is very similar to Chat GPT (or any AI interface). The primary functionality revolves around prompting (chatting) with the AI Agent.

### Selecting the AI Agent <a href="#selecting-the-ai-agent" id="selecting-the-ai-agent"></a>

The first step is selecting one of the AI Agents. AI Agents are created using raia Launch Pad and made available to access by users registered in Launch Pad. If you do not see any agents, make sure you have created atleast one and have been provided access in [**raia Launch Pad**](https://raia2.com).

### Ask the Agent a Question <a href="#ask-the-agent-a-question" id="ask-the-agent-a-question"></a>

Once you have chose the AI Agent, simply ask a question in the "Ask any Question..." text box at the bottom of the screen. You also may see some default prompts on the Agent's home screen right above the Chat window.

### Change to a different Agent <a href="#change-to-a-different-agent" id="change-to-a-different-agent"></a>

If you want to navigate to a different AI Agent, use the pull down menu at the top of the screen. You can search for the Agent you want to use, and it will refresh the screen with the new Agent.

### Conversations <a href="#conversations" id="conversations"></a>

Each conversation (thread) is saved on the left side of the screen. You can click on the conversation to view the messages at anytime. You can also easily rename the conversation by clicking on the three dot menu when you hover over the conversation title. Other features include downloading the conversation, deleting and adding to Memory of the Agent (if you want to train the Agent to remember the conversation for future recall).
