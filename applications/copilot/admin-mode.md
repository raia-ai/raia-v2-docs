# Admin Mode

One of the more powerful features of raia Copilot is Admin Mode. This is where a user (who has admin permissions to the AI Agent) can view all conversations. This is helpful if the Admin wants to oversee all conversations with other users (team members, customers, prospects, etc) and also helpful in human-feedback training.

### Using Admin Mode for Training / Feedback <a href="#using-admin-mode-for-training-feedback" id="using-admin-mode-for-training-feedback"></a>

One of the primary uses of raia Copilot is for Human Feedback Training. When an AI Agent is built in Launch Pad it is trained on specific information and to perform a specific task. Once the AI Agent is ready to be tested, you can use Copilot as way to test the AI and begin to provide real-time feedback on the answers it provides by clicking on Thumbs Up or Down and providing the correct answer.

The feedback goes back to raia Launch Pad as additional training to be added to the AI Agent to improve future responses.

### View User Details <a href="#view-user-details" id="view-user-details"></a>

In Admin you can also view User Details (if available) in the right side panel. This enables the Admin to view who is communicating with the AI Agent.
