# Mission Control

### üîç What Mission Control Does

At its core, **Mission Control** streamlines the entire outbound communication process by enabling users to:

#### Upload Target Lists

* Drag and drop or import CSV files containing email addresses and phone numbers.
* Automatically validates contact formats and prepares each record for campaign use.
* Supports segmented uploads for specialized targeting or A/B testing.

#### Launch Outreach Campaigns

* Sends hundreds of emails or text messages simultaneously using customized templates and subject lines.
* Integrates each message directly with the assigned AI Agent through its **API key**, ensuring continuity once a reply is received.
* Automatically tracks delivery success, failures, and bounce rates in real time.

#### Automate the Follow-Up

* Once a contact replies, the **AI Agent takes over the conversation** within seconds.
* The Agent handles responses, nurtures interest, and can guide leads toward actions such as booking meetings, confirming event attendance, or requesting more details.
* All conversations are logged and rated for quality and performance tracking.
