# Launching a Mission

## 🚀 Launching a Mission

Launching a mission is the final step in Mission Control. This is where you create, configure, and deploy your AI-powered outreach campaigns across **email** or **SMS**.

The launch process guides you through defining your campaign details, assigning an AI Agent, setting follow-ups, and choosing when to send. Everything is designed to make large-scale outreach simple, structured, and compliant.

***

### 🧭 Step 1: Define the Mission

After selecting **Launch Mission** from the sidebar, you’ll be taken directly to the setup flow.

Give your mission a clear **name** (for example, “Q4 Real Estate Promo” or “Tech Demo Outreach”).\
Then, write a **Mission Prompt** that explains the goal and tone for your AI Agent. This helps the Agent understand how to approach the conversation.

You can also use one of our **prebuilt templates**, such as:

* **Build Interest & Re-engage**
* **Qualify & Pass Along**
* **Drive to Appointment**

Each template provides a foundation for common campaign goals, but you can also create your own custom prompt if needed.

### ✉️ Step 2: Choose Channel

Select which communication channel to use:

* **Email** – Send personalized messages directly to inboxes.
* **SMS** – Send text messages to phone numbers.
* **Voice** – Coming soon.

### 👥 Step 3: Select Target Contacts

Choose one or more contact lists that you’ve uploaded previously.\
Each list represents the audience segment that this mission will target.

You can select multiple lists at once if your campaign applies to more than one group.

### 🤖 Step 4: Assign Agent

Select which **AI Agent** will power the mission.\
The Agent must already be connected to Mission Control and have the appropriate **Email** or **SMS** skill configured in Raia Launchpad.

### 📨 Step 5: Configure Initial Message

Choose how the first message will be generated for each contact:

1. **Personalized from Upload** – Uses message content included in your CSV upload (recommended).\
   This gives you full control over wording, formatting, and tone.
2. **Standard Mission Message** – Sends the same message to every contact.
3. **AI-Generated Message** – Allows the Agent to craft unique outreach messages based on your mission prompt and contact data.

### 🔁 Step 6: AI Follow-Up (Optional)

Mission Control allows you to automate follow-ups for contacts who don’t respond.\
The AI Agent will use the previous message context and mission prompt to continue the conversation naturally.

Available follow-up intervals include:

* **Day 3** – Quick reminder
* **Day 7** – One-week follow-up
* **Day 14** – Two-week re-engagement
* **Day 30** – Monthly check-in
* **Day 60** – Quarterly re-engage
* **Day 90** – Final outreach

This feature helps sustain engagement without additional manual work.\
If a contact requests to stop messaging, the AI will respect that automatically.

### 🗓️ Step 7: Schedule Launch

You can choose when to begin sending your campaign:

* **Launch Immediately** – Start the mission as soon as it’s created.
* **Schedule for Later** – Pick a specific date and time for launch.

Mission Control respects your **approved send window** to prevent messages from being delivered during off hours.

### ✅ Step 8: Review and Launch

Before launch, you’ll see a **summary preview** of all mission settings:

* Mission Name
* Target Contacts
* Communication Channel
* Assigned Agent
* Message Strategy
* Launch Timing
* AI Follow-Up

Review all details carefully. When ready, click **Launch Now** to begin.\
Your AI Agent will start reaching out to contacts and continue managing all replies automatically.

### 💡 What Happens Next

After launch, Mission Control will:

* Send personalized initial messages to your selected contacts.
* Limit sending to **100 contacts per mission per day** to protect deliverability and server reputation.
* Monitor and respond to replies automatically using your mission prompt.
* Keep all conversation history visible in the **Command Deck**.
* Provide full analytics including opens, replies, and engagement performance.
