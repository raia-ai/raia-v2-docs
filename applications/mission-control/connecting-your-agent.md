### ⚙️ Step 5: Verify Agent Skills

Before launching campaigns, make sure your AI Agent in **Raia Launchpad** has both the **Email Skill** and **SMS Skill** fully configured.\
These skills allow Mission Control to send and receive messages across both channels without issues.

If either skill is missing or incomplete, Mission Control will not be able to deliver outbound messages correctly.

***

### ✅ Connection Complete

Your AI Agent is now linked and ready to manage conversations for your campaigns.\
Mission Control will use this connection to:

* Send outbound emails and text messages.
* Automatically route replies to your AI Agent.
* Track all performance data and message logs inside your Mission Control dashboard.

You are now ready to upload your contact list and launch your first campaign.
