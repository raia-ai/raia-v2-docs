## 🛠️ How to Build an AI Agent in raia v2

**raia v2** makes it easy for anyone—technical or not—to build a powerful AI Agent that works across channels, understands your business, and performs real tasks. This guide will walk you through the **step-by-step process** using the **Launch Pad** workflow.

***

### 📍 Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

* A clear idea of what you want your Agent to do (sales, support, onboarding, etc.)
* Documents, FAQs, or websites your Agent should learn from (optional, but recommended)
* Access to raia v2&#x20;

***

### ✨ Step 1: Create a New Agent

1. Go to your **Launch Pad**
2. Click **“Create Agent”**
3. Select the **Agent Role**:
   * Choose from roles like _Sales Assistant_, _Support Bot_, _Internal Helpdesk_, etc.
   * This helps pre-configure the Agent with relevant capabilities.

📝 _Tip: Each role comes with a unique skill and prompt setup tailored for common business goals._

***

### 🧱 Step 2: Add Basic Information

You’ll be prompted to enter:

* **Public Name**: What end users will see (e.g., “Ask Ava”)
* **Internal Name**: For internal tracking
* **Description**: Briefly describe what the Agent does
* **Tags**: Add relevant tags to help search and categorize later
* **Avatar/Image** _(optional)_: Upload a logo or icon

✅ _All fields except tags and image are required to proceed._

***

### 🧠 Step 3: Write Basic Instructions

This is your Agent’s "job description."

1. Use simple, clear language to explain:
   * What the Agent should do
   * How it should behave (tone, goals, rules)
   * Any important business logic or phrases to avoid
2. Upload any documents or URLs your Agent should learn from
   * PDFs, manuals, internal policies, knowledge base articles
   * You can also add websites for scraping relevant content

🛠️ _Use the "Optimize with AI" button to improve your instructions with AI help._

***

### 📦 Step 4: Add Packs (Optional)

Packs are **prebuilt instruction sets** that train your Agent on specific skills or knowledge areas.

Popular examples:

* **Sales Pack**: Teaches your Agent how to follow up with leads
* **Support Pack**: Helps answer customer service questions
* **Q\&A Pack**: Handles frequently asked questions
* **Policy Pack**: Trains on compliance or internal procedures

✅ _You can skip this step or select multiple packs to combine their knowledge._

***

### 🧩 Step 5: Add Skills

Skills determine **how** your Agent communicates and what it can do.

Choose from:

* **Live Chat**: For website or portal interactions
* **Email**: Responds via email on your domain
* **SMS**: Text-based interaction (requires number setup)
* **API**: Headless Agent you can connect to your app
* **Campaigns**: Send one-to-many outreach via SMS or email
* **Calendar**: Helps schedule meetings or appointments
* **Webhooks**: Connect with third-party tools like CRMs

⚙️ _Each skill has setup options—like welcome messages, security settings, and branding._

***

### ✅ Step 6: Review and Launch

1. You’ll see a **summary page** with everything you configured:
   * Role, Description, Skills, Packs, Memory settings, and Appearance
2. Click **“Launch Agent”** when ready

Your Agent will now appear in your dashboard and is ready to use!

🎯 You can:

* Interact with it in **Copilot**
* Embed it on your website
* Assign it to a **Campaign**
* Share it with users or teammates

***

### 🔄 Ongoing Management
