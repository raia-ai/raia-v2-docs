# Escalation Skill

## üÜò Escalation Skill

The **Escalation Skill** ensures that critical user requests are addressed quickly and accurately by enabling seamless escalation from AI to human support.\
By monitoring conversations for predefined keywords or triggers, the system automatically notifies the right people via **email**, **SMS**, **webhook**, or **in-app alerts**.

***

### üí° Purpose

Escalation bridges the gap between automation and human intervention ‚Äî ensuring urgent or sensitive requests are handled by the appropriate team members.\
This reduces response delays, improves customer satisfaction, and safeguards against missed opportunities in critical interactions.

***

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Monitoring Conversations**\
   The AI watches for escalation keywords or conditions (e.g., ‚Äúurgent,‚Äù ‚Äúcancel account,‚Äù ‚Äúmedical emergency‚Äù).
2. **Triggering Escalation**\
   When triggered, the skill automatically sends a message to your designated recipients.
3. **Human Takeover**\
   Optionally, the assistant can switch to _manual conversation mode_ so a live agent can step in immediately.

### &#x20;Best Practices

* Keep escalation prompts **specific** and **actionable**.
* Use **auto mode** when a human agent needs to take over immediately.
* Regularly **test** your escalation flow to ensure alerts reach the correct team.
* Add **multiple recipients** for critical issues to prevent single-point failure.
