The Notifications Skill allows the AI agent to generate and send notifications to users based on specific triggers. By supporting multiple delivery channels such as SMS and email, it ensures timely and relevant communication.&#x20;

This skill enables seamless integration of automated alerts into workflows, helping users stay informed and responsive. Whether it is a status update, reminder, or important event, the Notifications Skill enhances engagement and operational efficiency.

### Example Use Cases

* Agent sends Notification and Transcript (with Summary and Score) to a Sales Person after a high scoring conversation with a lead.
* Agent sends Notification to Support Team for follow up or human feedback on support ticket resolution.
* Agent sends low scoring conversations to escalate to a team member to follow up and resolve what AI could not resolve.

**Agent Notifying you when a conversation is done**

The most common use case is sending a team member an SMS or Email when a conversation is completed by the AI Agent.  You can choose to be notified based on if the conversation hits a certain score as well.

The other option would be getting notified when a conversation begins.
