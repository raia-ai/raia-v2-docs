# Retrieval Skill

### üß† What Is the Retriever Skill?

The **retriever skill** is a mechanism that allows the system (an agent) to fetch contextual information from an **external vector database**, such as Pinecone, in real time. The retrieved data is then passed to OpenAI's models as **additional context**, enhancing the accuracy and specificity of the AI's responses.

Illya describes this as an industry-standard approach for augmenting language models with external knowledge.

### üîÑ Retrieval Flow

1. **Agent Sends Message**
   * When a user sends a message to an agent, the system checks whether the agent has any external retrievers configured.
2. **Query External Vector DB**
   * If retrievers are present, the system makes a **search query** to the external database (e.g., Pinecone), using the user's message as the query.
3. **Attach Retrieved Content**
   * The system retrieves relevant documents or embeddings from the vector DB and **attaches them as context** for the OpenAI API call.
4. **Generate Answer**
   * OpenAI uses both the user's query and the attached context to generate a more accurate response.

### üß© Key Fields and Configurations

When a user adds a retriever skill, they go through a configuration form with the following fields:

#### 1. **Retriever Type**

* Currently supports **Pinecone**, but is designed to support others (e.g., Weaviate, PostgreSQL with pgvector, APIs).
* Future plans include support for **non-vector retrievers** (e.g., SQL-based or API-based lookups).

#### 2. **Name**

* A label for the retriever setup (e.g., ‚ÄúSales Docs Retriever‚Äù).

#### 3. **API Key**

* The user's Pinecone API key is required to fetch data.
* Used to call Pinecone‚Äôs API and list all available **indexes**.

#### 4. **Index Selection**

* The system auto-fetches available **indexes** once the API key is verified.
* An **index** in Pinecone is equivalent to a **vector database**.

#### 5. **Namespace**

* Namespaces act like **tables** within the vector DB.
* Each namespace is isolated and must be explicitly selected.
* Required for querying Pinecone.

#### 6. **Field Name**

* Used to configure how data is chunked or presented (may relate to how metadata is tagged or retrieved).

#### 7. **Top-K**

* The number of top results (most relevant chunks) to return from the query.
* Controls the depth of context fed to OpenAI.

### üóÇ Data Hierarchy in Pinecone (as explained)

| Concept   | Pinecone Equivalent |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Index     | Database            |
| Namespace | Table               |
| Embedding | Row/document        |

Multiple namespaces can exist within a single index, and multiple indexes can be used by a single customer, depending on use cases (e.g., file search vs text search with different embedding dimensions).

### üõ† Feedback Management + Vector Store Upload Logic

In parallel, the team also updated how **feedback data** is managed and used in vector stores:

* **Daily Generation**: A feedback file is created daily per agent if new feedback exists.
* **Skip Re-upload Logic**: If a file is deleted from the vector store manually, it‚Äôs marked as such and **not re-uploaded** automatically.
* **Goal**: Avoid polluting the vector DB with unwanted feedback and give admins fine control over what training data is stored.

#### Future Plan:

* A **skill UI** is planned to show all feedbacks.
* Admins will be able to **view, edit, delete**, or **flag to ignore** feedback directly‚Äîrather than navigating Copilot manually.

### ‚úÖ Key Benefits of the Retriever Skill

* Supports **external knowledge injection** dynamically.
* Enables **flexible customer-specific indexing** (multi-index and multi-namespace setups).
* Integrates seamlessly with OpenAI for contextual grounding.
* Future extensible to support API retrievers and traditional databases.
