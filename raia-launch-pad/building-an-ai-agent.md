# Building an AI Agent

## Able to choose agent role

Choose a role that matches your use case the best. Your selection will not directly effect your agent, however we may recommend certain skills or provide guidance on your instructional prompts based on your selection.&#x20;

## Able to edit basic information

We provide every agent two names. The public name is what people would naturally call the agent (e.g. Bob). The internal name is a more detailed name / description that can simplify distinguishing two agents that may be named the same (e.g. Bob from Sales, Bob from Support). \
\
Your short description helps users (internal) know more about the role of the agent. You can add tags as well to group agents to make it easier to find via search.

The logo will be used in the Live Chat and Copilot user interface.

## Able to setup basic prompting

The instructions are one of the most important parts of building an agent. This is where you define the roles, objective, personality, guardrails, etc of the Agent. [See more details here](../ai-training-guide/setup-of-instructions.md). You can also upload documents here for the AI to add to it's training.\
\
(Note: it's ok to skip this part, and come back to edit these later. Most likely you won't have a clear idea on instructions or documents ready to upload at this stage.)

## Able to choose from premade Info Packs

Packs are pre-made instructions that we can add to your instructions to help you get started. You can easily edit these under the training tab by viewing the instructions after you agent is created.\
\
(Note: You can skip this part as well and always add these packs at a later time)

## Able to choose what skills to use

Skills are essentially tools and functionality that is native in the raia platform.  You can easily add/remove skills at any time. If you don't know what skills to add at this point, you can skip for now.
