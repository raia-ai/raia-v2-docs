This section in basic user information allows you to define key user identifiers (like Fk ID and Fk User ID), set the user's preferred communication channel (such as email or SMS), and customize message content by including their first name or a signature. These preferences help personalize and route communications more effectively, ensuring messages are delivered in the most appropriate format for the user.
