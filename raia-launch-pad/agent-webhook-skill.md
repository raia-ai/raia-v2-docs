## Customizable Agent Webhook

A fully customizable webhook allows your AI agent to communicate in real time with external systems or services, enabling dynamic data exchange such as updating CRMs, sending notifications, or retrieving live info. This flexibility ensures your AI can adapt to specific business workflows, making it more powerful, responsive, and integrated into your tech stack.

## Webhook Name & Description

The **Webhook Name** is a clear, recognizable label used to identify the purpose or target of the webhook, helping you stay organized when managing multiple integrations. The **Webhook Description** provides a brief explanation of what the webhook does, offering context for its function and usage within your system.

## Webhook to call to

The “Webhook to Call” field specifies the exact URL the AI will send data to when the webhook is triggered. This allows real-time communication between your AI agent and external systems, enabling dynamic actions like database updates, CRM integration, or workflow automation.

## Webhook Trigger Condition

Webhook trigger conditions define when an external action (like sending data to another app) should be executed during a conversation—such as after each message, when a dialog starts, or when it ends. Choosing the right trigger ensures timely and relevant data transfer, automation, or notifications based on the flow of the chat.

## Header Name & Value

Header names and values are key-value pairs sent with web requests that provide essential metadata—like authentication tokens, content type, or custom identifiers—allowing secure, structured, and contextual communication between systems. They're especially important for APIs and webhooks to verify, route, or process requests correctly.

## Ability to test your Webhook

Being able to test your webhook beforehand is crucial to ensure it’s correctly configured, the endpoint is reachable, and the expected data is being sent and received properly. It helps catch errors early, saving time and preventing issues when the AI is live and interacting with real users or systems.
