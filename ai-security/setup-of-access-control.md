# Setup of Access Control

## 🔐 Setting Up Access Control in Raia v2

### Overview

Access control in **raia v2** ensures that users interact with AI Agents and organizational data based on clearly defined roles and permissions. This system operates across **three levels**:

1. **Moderator Level** (Raia staff)
2. **Organization Level** (Your company and team)
3. **Agent Level** (Individual AI Agents)

Each level has distinct user roles and capabilities. Here's how to configure and manage access at each level.

***

### 🏢 Organization-Level Access

These roles define what users can do within your company’s account.

#### **Org Owner**

* Full access to the organization
* Can manage users, agents, packs, functions, subscriptions
* Can create, edit, and delete agents
* Can assign access to others

#### **Org Admin**

* Nearly identical permissions to Org Owner
* Can manage agents and users within the organization
* Cannot delete the organization

#### **Org User**

* Can interact with agents
* Cannot edit or configure agents
* Cannot manage users or settings

Copilot User

* Only Access Agents when shared by other Admin
* Only access Agent via Copilot App

***

### 🤖 Agent-Level Access

These roles control what a user can do with a specific AI Agent.

#### **Agent Owner**

* Full access to the Agent
* Can change settings, train the agent, assign skills, upload documents
* Can grant/revoke agent access to other users
* Can delete the agent

#### **Agent Admin**

* Almost full access like Owner, but **cannot delete or transfer ownership** of the agent

#### **Editor**

* Can configure skills and content
* Can use the agent
* **Cannot delete or reassign** the agent or access its training data

#### **Authenticated User**

* Requires login (magic link, code, or authentication)
* Can interact with the agent in its intended use case (chat, SMS, etc.)

#### **Public User**

* Anonymous access
* Limited to front-end agent interfaces (e.g. public live chat)

***

### 🎛️ How to Assign Access

You can assign or revoke roles from the **Agent Settings > Security tab** or the **Organization Management > Users section**:

1. **Add a New User**:
   * Go to `Users` > `Add User`
   * Enter email, assign organization and/or agent roles
2. **Change User Role**:
   * Navigate to the user’s profile
   * Edit their Org or Agent level roles as needed
3. **Remove Access**:
   * Under user details, choose "Revoke Access" from the Org or Agent they are assigned to
4. **Set Always Admin Mode** _(Copilot)_:
   * For agent admins, this enables visibility into all agent threads
   * Found in personal settings in Copilot app
