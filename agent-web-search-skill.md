## Web Search

Web search lets AI provide up-to-date, real-world information that isn't in its training data, making answers more accurate and relevant. Being able to choose between AI models allows users to tailor responses based on strengths—like reasoning, speed, or integration with specific services. Together, they boost flexibility, precision, and trust in the AI’s output.

## **Importance of Web Search in AI**

### **Up-to-Date Information**

AI models are trained on data up to a certain point. Web search lets the AI access current events, pricing, live documentation, or recent updates that aren't part of its training.

### Fact Verification

Helps **verify facts**, cross-check claims, and avoid hallucinated or outdated answers.

### Niche or Local Queries

Essential for **location-specific** or **specialized** information (e.g. Romanian tax law changes, product availability, or business hours).

### Source Transparency

Web search allows AI to cite **specific sources**, increasing **user trust** and **accountability**.
