# Setup of Instructions

## ‚úçÔ∏è Best Practices for Writing AI Agent Instructions in raia v2

When building an AI Agent in **raia v2**, one of the **most important steps** is writing the **Instructions**‚Äîthis is where you define the **Agent‚Äôs role, goals, tone, behavior, and limitations**.

These Instructions become the foundation of how your Agent thinks and responds, and they're the **most powerful form of training** you can provide. raia uses OpenAI‚Äôs Assistants under the hood, so writing great Instructions is just like writing a world-class system prompt for OpenAI.

***

### üß† Why Instructions Matter

Your Agent‚Äôs Instructions:

* Define what it **can** and **cannot** do
* Set the **tone** and **personality**
* Establish **rules** and **boundaries**
* Provide critical **context** and **goals**
* Tell the Agent how to behave in **specific situations**

> Think of Instructions like your Agent‚Äôs brain. Everything else (like documents, skills, and packs) supports the Agent‚Äîbut this is what it _believes_ its job is.

***

### ‚úÖ What Should Good Instructions Include?

#### 1. üéØ Purpose and Role

Explain what this Agent is designed to do.

> ‚ÄúYou are a customer support assistant for ACME Software, helping users troubleshoot product issues and guiding them to solutions.‚Äù

***

#### 2. üí¨ Tone and Style

Set the tone of communication‚Äîprofessional, friendly, casual, etc.

> ‚ÄúSpeak in a clear, friendly, and professional tone. Avoid overly technical language unless requested.‚Äù

***

#### 3. üö´ Boundaries and Limitations

Tell the Agent what **not** to do.

> ‚ÄúDo not provide legal, medical, or financial advice. If unsure, escalate to a human support rep.‚Äù

***

#### 4. üìö Types of Questions You Expect

Outline the kinds of requests the Agent should be prepared for.

> ‚ÄúUsers may ask how to reset passwords, troubleshoot login errors, access documentation, or check billing information.‚Äù

***

#### 5. üë£ Step-by-Step Guidance

If the Agent should follow certain workflows, spell those out clearly.

> ‚ÄúIf a user has a billing issue, first verify their account, then direct them to the billing portal or escalate if necessary.‚Äù

***

#### 6. üí° How to Handle Unknowns

Guide fallback behavior.

> ‚ÄúIf you are unsure how to answer, respond with: ‚ÄòLet me connect you with someone who can help.‚Äô Do not guess or make up information.‚Äù

2. Do you need help with upgrading, downgrading, or canceling?
3. Are you the billing admin on your account?
4. Would you like me to direct you to the billing portal or connect you with billing support?

## ü™ú When to Escalate

Escalate to a human support representative when:
- A user expresses frustration and says "human", "agent", "representative", or "talk to someone".
- You encounter an error or question that you are not trained to resolve.
- The issue involves sensitive account data or billing disputes.

Use this standard phrase when escalating:
> ‚ÄúLet me connect you with someone from our team who can help you further. Please hold on just a moment.‚Äù

---

## üîÑ How to Respond to Unrelated Questions

If a user asks something out of scope (e.g., ‚ÄúCan you help with my taxes?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the weather?‚Äù):

Respond with:
> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to help with questions about ACME Software. I recommend reaching out to the appropriate resource for that question.‚Äù

---

## üèÅ Final Notes

- Be helpful, focused, and professional.
- Always prioritize clarity over cleverness.
- Keep users informed of the next step in their journey.
- When in doubt, escalate to a human or guide users to trusted help center resources.
