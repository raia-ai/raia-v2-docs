# Setup of Knowledge Base

## 📚 Best Practice: Consolidate Training into One Knowledge Base for Your AI Agent

When training an AI Agent—especially one that will evolve alongside your business—it’s critical to **establish a single source of truth**.

Many teams start by uploading scattered documents like PDFs, Word files, or slide decks. While this works at first, it quickly becomes unmanageable. As your business grows or your offerings change, trying to track what’s been updated (or not) across dozens of training files becomes a recipe for confusion—and inconsistent agent performance.

The solution?\
✅ **Consolidate your training into a centralized, up-to-date Knowledge Base.**

### 🧭 Why a Unified Knowledge Base Matters

An AI Agent is only as smart as the content it’s trained on. If your Agent is referencing outdated policies, conflicting procedures, or duplicate instructions, it risks:

* Giving incorrect answers
* Creating poor user experiences
* Eroding customer trust
* Confusing your team with misaligned behavior

That’s why it’s **best practice to store all your Agent’s knowledge in one, well-organized location**—a knowledge base built specifically for ongoing maintenance and accuracy.

### 🧠 The Power of a “Source of Truth”

Your AI Agent is meant to help your team scale, not add more work.

By centralizing your training content into a **single knowledge base**, you:

* ✅ Ensure consistency in answers
* ✅ Know exactly where to update content when something changes
* ✅ Prevent duplication or conflicting information
* ✅ Give your AI Agent one clean, trusted source to retrieve answers from
* ✅ Enable real-time or scheduled updates to keep your AI current

### 🛠️ What Makes a Great Knowledge Base for AI Agents?

Here are the features you want in a knowledge base that supports AI training—especially in raia v2 (which uses OpenAI Assistants and Vector Store technology):

#### 1. **Single Entry Point for All Topics**

Organize content by topics or categories so the Agent can retrieve the most relevant section without crawling multiple files.

#### 2. **Markdown or JSON Export**

The best knowledge bases support **Markdown (.md)** or **JSON** exports. These formats:

* Keep structure and headings intact
* Are easily digestible by AI
* Can be chunked and embedded in vector search for semantic understanding

> raia v2 supports both Markdown and JSON files in its Vector Store and training pipelines.

#### 3. **Easily Editable by the Team**

Choose a tool your non-technical team can update without dev support.\
When policies, features, or pricing changes—**any team member should be able to make updates**.

#### 4. **Real-Time or Manual Syncing**

Your knowledge base should support:

* **Scheduled syncs** to re-train your AI Agent regularly
* Or **manual re-uploads** of exports if you're not using a direct integration

> Example: You update a help article → Export Markdown → Upload into raia → Agent is now current.

#### 5. **Clear Versioning and Change Tracking**

Track what was updated and when, so your team has full visibility—and your AI doesn’t “hallucinate” outdated policies.

### 📝 Tools That Work Well for AI-Ready Knowledge Bases

| Tool                     | Pros                            | Export Format Support     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Notion**               | Easy for teams, markdown export | ✅ Markdown                |
| **Confluence**           | Great for technical orgs        | ✅ JSON / Markdown via API |
| **GitBook**              | Designed for docs, easy to edit | ✅ Markdown                |
| **Custom CMS**           | Fully controlled by your team   | ✅ JSON / Markdown         |
| **HelpDocs / HelpScout** | Designed for support centers    | ✅ Markdown                |

If you don’t have a knowledge base yet, even a **Google Doc or Notion workspace** is better than a folder of random PDFs.

### 🧩 Real-World Use Case

Let’s say your AI Agent helps customers understand your product’s return policy. That policy changes quarterly.

**Without a knowledge base**:\
You have 3 PDFs and a PowerPoint file floating around. One gets updated—but you forget which one the AI is trained on. Now it gives the wrong info.

**With a knowledge base**:\
You update the “Returns” article in your central KB, export it, and re-upload it to raia. The Agent is now instantly aligned with your latest policy.

***

### 🔄 Updating Your Agent Becomes Effortless

With a knowledge base in place, your update workflow becomes:

1. Team updates an article in the KB
2. Export to Markdown or JSON
3. Re-upload to raia or retrain your Agent
4. Done—your Agent is now current and reliable

No re-uploading 15 files. No guessing what’s still accurate. No retraining from scratch.

***

### 🧭 Final Recommendations

* **Start consolidating now.** Even if you only have a few documents, get them into one place.
* **Standardize formatting** in Markdown or structured JSON.
* **Update consistently**—and re-train your Agent regularly.
* **Empower your team** to contribute and edit. The AI gets better when everyone helps keep the knowledge sharp.

> A well-fed Agent is a high-performing Agent.
