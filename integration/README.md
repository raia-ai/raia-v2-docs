## 🔗 Integration Options with raia : Extending AI Agents into Your Workflows

raia is built to be more than just an AI assistant—it’s designed to act as a **fully integrated teammate**, capable of plugging into your systems and workflows in real time.

While raia AI Agents work out of the box across omni-channel communication platforms like **SMS**, **Email**, **Live Chat**, and even **Voice**, many businesses want to go further. They want to use these Agents **inside workflows**, trigger them from other tools, or let them talk to CRMs, ticketing systems, or internal apps.

That’s where RAIA’s flexible **integration options** come into play.

***

### 🧠 Why Integrate Your AI Agent?

Even though raia Agents are ready to chat from the moment they’re launched, integration unlocks powerful new capabilities:

* Let your CRM or helpdesk system **trigger an AI response**
* Push lead data, tickets, or summaries to a **3rd-party system**
* Allow your agent to **query your database** or **run internal logic**

Whether you're aiming for seamless customer journeys or smart internal operations, **integration makes your AI Agent more connected, useful, and valuable.**
