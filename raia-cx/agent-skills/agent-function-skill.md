## Multiple Functions per Agent

You have the ability to have multiple functions setup per agent

## Able to fully customize your AI Agent Function

Being able to fully customize your AI Agent function is important because it lets you define specific tasks the AI can perform, such as pulling data, calculating values, or interacting with tools based on user input. This enables more intelligent, action-oriented conversations where the AI doesn't just respond but actually does something useful and task-specific.

## Choosing a Function from a template

In an Organization it is possible to have Functions previously created, allowing you to simple import them directly into AI Agent and even further customizing them for a more specific Agent purpose.

## Function Name & Internal Name

The **Function Name** is the user-facing label that describes what the function does, while the **Internal Name** is used behind the scenes for system reference and integration purposes.

## Function Instructions

Function Instructions are crucial because they clearly define what the AI function is supposed to do, ensuring the AI executes the task accurately and stays aligned with your intended purpose. Well-written instructions guide the modelâ€™s behavior, reduce errors, and improve reliability when triggering specific actions.

## Function Webhook

The "Webhook to Call" is essential in a function because it defines the external endpoint where the AI sends data to execute the task, such as fetching real-time info or triggering an external action. Without it, the function can't connect to or interact with outside systems, making the task incomplete or non-functional.

## Function Parameters

Function parameters are crucial because they define the inputs your AI needs to perform a task accurately, such as user details, query values, or settings. Structuring these parameters ensures the function runs dynamically and correctly based on real-time user input or context.
