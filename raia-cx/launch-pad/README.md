# Launch Pad

The **raia Launch Pad** is the central control hub for building, managing, and monitoring your AI ecosystem. It gives you the tools to **design intelligent agents**, **organize knowledge**, **extend capabilities**, and **track performance**—all in one unified interface.

***

#### **1. Build & Manage AI Agents**

* **Create new agents** from scratch or clone existing ones.
* Define **agent personalities, skills, and behaviors**.
* Connect agents to **vector stores** for instant access to curated knowledge.
* Assign **training data** from raia Academy or external sources.

***

#### **2. Create & Deploy Knowledge Packs**

* Build **Packs**—collections of related documents, datasets, or AI-ready content.
* Assign packs to specific agents to **scope their expertise**.
* Update or remove packs to keep knowledge **fresh and relevant**.

***

#### **3. Build & Integrate Custom Functions**

* Create **Functions** that extend agent capabilities:
  * Data lookups
  * API calls
  * Automation workflows
* Link functions to specific triggers or agent commands.

***

#### **4. Monitor Conversations & Interactions**

* View **real-time and historical conversations** between agents and users.
* Track **engagement metrics**, user queries, and response quality.
* Identify trends, gaps, or recurring issues in agent performance.

***

#### **5. Access Detailed Logs**

* Inspect **system logs** for each agent to troubleshoot behavior.
* Review **function execution logs** to monitor custom workflows.
* Track **knowledge retrieval activity** to understand how agents use their vector stores.

***

#### **6. Manage Users & Permissions**

* View **active users** interacting with agents.
* Manage **roles and access permissions** for team members.
* Control who can **create, edit, or deploy** agents, packs, and functions.

***

#### **Why Launch Pad is Essential**

The Launch Pad unifies **agent creation, knowledge management, function development, monitoring, and governance** into a single platform.\
This makes it possible to:

* Rapidly **deploy new AI capabilities**.
* Maintain **control and compliance** over your AI ecosystem.
* Continuously **optimize performance** based on real user interactions.
