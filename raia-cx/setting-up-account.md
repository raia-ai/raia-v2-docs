***

### 3. **Build Your AI Agent: The Wizard Walkthrough**

raia uses a **step-by-step wizard**. Here’s how the process typically flows:

#### **Step 1:** [**Define the Agent’s Role**](../launch-plan/ai-agent-roles/)

* Choose what your AI agent will do: Sales, Support, Operations, Internal HR, etc.
* Pick a role template or start from scratch.
* **Pro Tip:** The role determines your agent’s skillset and personality. You can customize tone and objectives.

***

#### **Step 2: Name & Describe Your Agent**

* **Enter a public-friendly name** (required).
* **Add an internal name** (required for your internal reference).
* **Upload a logo or avatar** (optional, helps visually distinguish agents).
* **Write a short description** (required, helps users know the agent’s purpose).
* **Add tags** (optional, for quick search later).

***

#### **Step 3:** [**Provide Instructions & Training Data**](agent-management/agent-training-tab.md)

* **Instructions:** Write the “job description” or rules for your agent. This shapes how it responds.
* **Upload documents:** Attach PDFs, FAQs, or knowledge files. This becomes the agent’s knowledge base.
* **Add URLs for scraping:** Give websites if you want the agent to pull in more information (raia validates and avoids duplicates).
* **(Optional) Add packs:** Use pre-built training packs for common use cases (e.g., mortgage, support, sales).

***

#### **Step 4:** [**Select Skills**](../ai-agent-skills/)

* raia agents come with built-in skills: **Live Chat, SMS, Email, Voice, APIs, Calendar, Campaigns, Webhooks**, etc.
* Choose the communication channels and integrations your agent needs.
* **Note:** At least one skill is required (Live Chat is default). You can add or remove skills later.

***

#### **Step 5:** [**Connect Integrations**](../integration/)

* Link to your CRM, calendar, or other apps via API keys or OAuth.
* Configure permissions (least privilege is best).
* Test the connections.

***

#### **Step 6: Review and Launch**

* Preview your agent: Check summary, training sources, skills, and integrations.
* Test with simulated conversations using raia’s built-in tools (“Copilot”).
* If ready, **click “Launch”** or “Activate” to deploy your agent.

***

### 4. **Manage & Monitor Your Agents**

* All your agents appear in the **Agents dashboard**.
* You can switch between **card and table views**, search by tags, mark favorites, and personalize agents’ visuals/colors for easy identification.
* Use **Copilot** for real conversations, human-in-the-loop oversight, and feedback training (rate answers, edit replies, intervene if needed).

***

### 5. **Invite Users and Set Permissions**

* raia supports **multiple user levels**: Super Admin, Org Owner, Admin, Agent Owner, Editor, etc.
* Invite team members via email, assign them to roles, and control their access to agents and data.

***

### 6. **Advanced: Multi-Channel and Security Setup**

* Configure additional skills and channels (SMS, Email, Web Chat).
* Set up 2FA, audit trails, and access controls for compliance.

***

#### **Tips for Success**

* **Start with a focused use case** (e.g., sales lead qualifier or FAQ bot).
* **Upload clean, relevant documents** for best results.
* Use the **feedback loop**: test, adjust instructions, and retrain.
* Leverage raia’s support by emailing support@raiaAI.com or launching the raia Agent Live Chat in the app if you get stuck or want a demo.

***

Setting up a raia account and building your first agent is designed to be **zero-code, fast, and intuitive**. You’ll follow a guided wizard, supply instructions and knowledge, choose skills and channels, connect to your tools, and launch—all in a single session if you’re prepared with your data.
